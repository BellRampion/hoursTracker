# hoursTracker
Program to track hours for different activities, specifically volunteer hours

This includes a Linux executable, a file to hold the list of activity files to log hours in, an activity file with hours in it, and the .c file. 

To add a new activity, simply create a new file in the same directory with the name of the organization or activity (abbreveriations are great) and add the name (complete with extension) to the fileOptions file. Rerun the program, and your new activity file will appear in the list! Enter the name of the file to log more hours. To subtract hours, add a negative number of hours.
